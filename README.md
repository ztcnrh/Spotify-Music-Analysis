# Spotify Music Analysis Project - Trends, Comparison, and Correlations

## Background

This was the first data analysis project in the Penn Data Boot Camp curriculum. As a team, we wanted to do something fun, exciting, and insightful while satisfying the baseline requirements. We searched through the web's databases, brainstormed ideas across various topics and landed on a dataset from Kaggle, the ["Spotify Dataset 1921-2020 Tracks"](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data_by_year.csv) dataset.

The data contained 170k+ songs collected by the dataset author (Yamac Eren Ay) from Spotify's Web API. Each row was a unique song track with its song facts (authors, release date, etc.), numerical audio feature ratings (acousticness, danceability, loudness, etc.), and Spotify specific user ratings (popularity). The author did a good job cleaning the organizing the datasets so the team had minimal necessary data cleaning to perform. Below is a snapshot of the data content:

<strong>Primary:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>id (Id of track generated by Spotify)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Numerical:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>acousticness (Ranges from 0 to 1)</li>
  <li>danceability (Ranges from 0 to 1)</li>
  <li>energy (Ranges from 0 to 1)</li>
  <li>duration_ms (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k)</li>
  <li>instrumentalness (Ranges from 0 to 1)</li>
  <li>valence (Ranges from 0 to 1)</li>
  <li>popularity (Ranges from 0 to 100)</li>
  <li>tempo (Float typically ranging from 50 to 150)</li>
  <li>liveness (Ranges from 0 to 1)</li>
  <li>loudness (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0)</li>
  <li>speechiness (Ranges from 0 to 1)</li>
  <li>year (Ranges from 1921 to 2020)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Dummy:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>mode (0 = Minor, 1 = Major)</li>
  <li>explicit (0 = No explicit content, 1 = Explicit content)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Categorical:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>key (All keys on octave encoded as values ranging from 0 to 11, starting on C as 0, C# as 1 and so onâ€¦)</li>
  <li>artists (List of artists mentioned)</li>
  <li>release_date (Date of release mostly in yyyy-mm-dd format, however precision of date may vary)</li>
  <li>name (Name of the song)</li>
</ul>

## Objective

The story of sound recording, and reproduction, began in 1877, when the man of a thousand patents, Thomas Edison, invented the phonograph. The commercialized music industry has only been around for about 100 years as the recording and radio technology emerged in the early 90s.

<strong>In this project, our objective was to <em>uncover music trends</em>. In other words, the goal was to understand how artists, genres, the audio features and the popularity of songs developed over time, through the perspective of Spotify and its users. We did this by using a series of models and approaches including:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Time Series Analysis</li>
  <li>Summary Statistics</li>
  <li>Aggregation</li>
  <li>Radar Charts</li>
  <li>Correlation Analysis</li>
</ol>
